*Run with arguments:* ./test/criticalpracticalreason.c2-3200 

## Description

Re-running the func-20-2-2 example that has been building up trainable components over time. 
This will measure whether a single run arrives faster at the same loss of about 2.09 in 70 iterations.

From this, the aim is to compare whether adjusting the size of certain layers will assist, specifically
the wide Dense layer mid-stream.
