Run with arguments ./test/critiquepracticalreason_00_kant_64kb.c2cb-3200 none

## Description

Same as previous with double frame sequence length

Back to 1550 before blowout. Switch to SGD

Started to get something useful in generation...

Stopped at 5160. Make the frame sequence length 400 and
use the current weights to load

Restarted at 5160 with seq_step = 398 as the loss jumped 
and maybe this was the cause.
