Run with arguments ./test/critiquepracticalreason_00_kant_64kb.c2cb-3200 

## Description

Added a softmax layer to the encoder. It still seems reasonable
that encoding producing a simplified output could assist
generation.

Also, added the he_normal initializers across most of the
remaining layers of autoencoder, after the tests using it
with the generator were positive.
